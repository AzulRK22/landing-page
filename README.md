## About this repository

This repository brings together the different sides of my work:

- **Professional experience** across frontend engineering, enterprise delivery, Android, and product development.
- **Selected products and case studies** spanning web, AI-assisted tools, mobility, environmental intelligence, commerce, and native iOS.
- **Hackathon work and awards**, including placements at HDC México, HDC Brasil, and HackNation.
- **Technical advocacy** through YouTube, TikTok, learning activity, and practical product storytelling.
- **Credentials and resume**, with certifications across frontend, mobile, cloud, and software engineering.
- **Independent products**, including CloseCut and its dedicated public microsite.

The project is intentionally lightweight: semantic HTML, modular CSS, and vanilla JavaScript deployed through GitHub Pages. There is no framework, package manager, bundler, or build step required for the public site.

## Portfolio experience

The main site is designed as more than a project gallery. It includes:

- professional experience and responsibilities;
- skills across React, JavaScript, TypeScript, SwiftUI, SwiftData, Kotlin, Firebase, REST APIs, and cloud fundamentals;
- measurable achievements and hackathon outcomes;
- an editorial “What I bring” section;
- technical advocacy and media;
- photography and event highlights;
- Meta, AWS, Google, and Infosys certifications;
- an accessible HTML resume summary and downloadable PDF;
- responsive project galleries and progressive enhancement.

## Independent product: CloseCut

CloseCut is one part of the wider portfolio: a private, local-first iOS Journal that helps people remember what they watched, why it mattered, and what to watch next. It is currently available as an internal TestFlight beta.

Its independent `/closecut/` microsite includes:

- a responsive product landing page built with real app screenshots;
- Private Journal, Quick Add, Timeline, QuickPick, Want to Watch, Circles, Watch Plans, and Cinema Memories;
- accessible mobile navigation and reduced-motion support;
- Privacy Policy in English and Spanish;
- Terms of Use and Support;
- real TestFlight calls to action;
- a six-volume CloseCut Library foundation with all book content intentionally unpublished;
- TMDB attribution;
- Open Graph, Twitter, canonical, Apple, and JSON-LD metadata.

The product site has its own dark, cinematic visual system in `closecut/closecut.css`, while remaining connected to the main portfolio through navigation and shared deployment infrastructure.

## Local development

No installation is required. Start any static file server from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

- Portfolio: <http://localhost:8000/>
- CloseCut: <http://localhost:8000/closecut/>

Using a server instead of opening files directly ensures folder routes, relative assets, and navigation behave like GitHub Pages.

## CloseCut asset workflow

Real iOS screenshots are converted into optimized full-size and mobile WebP variants with the existing conversion script:

```bash
python3 scripts/convert_images_to_webp.py --closecut-screenshots
```

The optional conversion utility requires [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/) in the active Python environment. The website itself does not depend on Python or Pillow at runtime.

Generated assets use descriptive kebab-case names inside `closecut/assets/screenshots/`. Source PNG screenshots are retained locally as conversion masters and ignored by Git.

The public TestFlight URL for the microsite is centralized in `closecut/closecut.js`. Update `TESTFLIGHT_URL` there if the beta destination changes; every element marked with `data-testflight-link` reads from that constant.

## Content and maintenance

### Portfolio scripts

- `assets/js/nav.js` — shared mobile navigation.
- `assets/js/home.js` — home reveals and performance metrics.
- `assets/js/projects.js` — project filters, Swiper, and Lottie setup.
- `assets/js/tech.js` — content reveals and Duolingo rendering.
- `assets/js/analytics.js` — portfolio engagement and outbound-link events.

### Duolingo data

The widget reads from `assets/data/duolingo.json`. Refresh it with:

```bash
node scripts/update-duo.mjs
```

The script tries the public endpoint first and can fall back to a Playwright login flow. That fallback requires Playwright to be available locally. Environment variables such as `DUO_PROFILE`, `DUO_USER`, and `DUO_PASS` may be required and must never be committed.

### Styling

- Runtime styles live in `assets/css/` and `closecut/closecut.css`.
- `assets/sass/` contains the original HTML5 UP sources and legacy adjustments.
- The portfolio background is `images/Background/bg.webp`.
- Rebuilding the legacy Sass is not required for normal content or CloseCut maintenance.

## Release checklist

Before publishing changes:

```bash
git diff --check
node --check closecut/closecut.js
node --check assets/js/home.js
node --check assets/js/projects.js
node --check assets/js/tech.js
xmllint --noout Sitemap.xml
```

Also verify:

- local routes and relative assets;
- mobile navigation and keyboard focus;
- 320 px through 1440 px layouts without horizontal overflow;
- portfolio cards, galleries, embeds, and resume access;
- `prefers-reduced-motion` behavior;
- Privacy, Terms, and Support links;
- the public TestFlight destination;
- canonical URLs, sitemap entries, and robots configuration;
- that no credentials, tester data, or source-only assets are staged.
