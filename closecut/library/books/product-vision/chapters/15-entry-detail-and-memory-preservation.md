# 15. Entry Detail and Memory Preservation

**Purpose.** The canonical reading surface for one memory and its owner-controlled lifecycle.

**Status:** Implemented

## User Need

I want one trustworthy place to reread, complete, edit, share, or remove a memory I own.

## Product Behavior

Entry Detail displays the complete memory, metadata, ownership, visibility, and sync status. Edit and delete remain owner actions; Circle detail remains read-only.

## Current Implementation

- **Private Entry Sharing (implemented).** Selected Circle sharing is explicit and private by default. Circle-side entry detail is read-only.
- `CloseCut/Features/Entries`
- `CloseCut/Features/Social/Circle`

## Near-Term Direction

Improve memory resurfacing, sharing clarity, and lifecycle confidence.

## Long-Term Vision

A rich, portable memory object linking personal, cinema, and trusted shared context.

## Requirements

- The Entry Detail and Memory Preservation experience must state its primary user job clearly through hierarchy and behavior rather than explanatory feature lists.
- Current behavior must remain distinguishable from future capability in product copy, release notes, marketing, and internal specifications.
- Private data must not become visible outside its intended context through default state, fallback behavior, logging, analytics, or sync reconciliation.
- All meaningful states must define a recovery path or an honest terminal explanation.
- Accessibility behavior must be specified with the same priority as visual behavior.
- The feature must add durable value to personal memory, decision confidence, trusted coordination, or product trust.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The shipped behavior matches the current-product description and evidence paths in Appendix B.
- A new user can understand the purpose of Entry Detail and Memory Preservation without external documentation.
- The feature does not require public identity, follower relationships, or engagement mechanics.
- Offline, empty, error, permission, and pending states preserve context and do not imply data loss.
- VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, contrast, touch targets, and non-color status cues are verified for the relevant surfaces.
- Instrumentation, when present, measures the intended outcome rather than raw taps alone.

## Edge Cases

- No local data and no network.
- Local data exists while the remote copy is older or unavailable.
- The user revokes permission or loses Circle membership during an active flow.
- Metadata becomes unavailable after an item has been saved.
- The app is terminated during a pending write or navigation transition.
- The same item is encountered through multiple origins or contexts.

## Privacy and Accessibility Implications

The feature must minimize collected data, preserve context boundaries, expose sharing and synchronization states in language, and support VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, sufficient contrast, reduced motion, and non-color status.

## Success Signals

- People complete the intended job without needing support or external explanation.
- The feature creates a meaningful transition to another core loop step.
- Reported accidental sharing, lost data, and unrecoverable errors remain near zero.
- Qualitative feedback describes increased memory value, decision confidence, or trusted coordination.
